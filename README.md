##QT5 RaspberryPI

This project builds QT5 and QT Webengine debian packages for the RaspberryPI.

###Requirements

You will need a powerful - 4 CPU or higher recommended-  Intel 64 bit computer with Debian Jessie.
The additional software needed on the host will be installed by running `./host-bootstrap.py`.

###Build

Build is separated in two stages.

Cross compilation of QT5, webengine and cross compilation tools: `buildall.sh cross`,
and native compilation of the core tools, for the RaspberryPI: `buildall.sh native`.

On completion, the `pkgs` directory will contain the Debian files to publish on the repository.

 * libqt5all.deb
 * libqtwebengine.deb
 * libqt5all-dev.deb
 * libqtwebengine-dev.deb
 * libqt5-native-tools.deb
 * libqt5-cross-tools.deb

###Development

QT5 and Webenegine apps can be compiled using the packages above, in two different ways: native or cross compiled.

####Native compilation

You will need a RaspberryPI or a Rasbian based sysroot. Install the `-dev` packages on the sysroot along
with native tools package. Set your `PATH` to point to `/usr/local/qt5/bin`. You are now ready to build.

####Cross compilation

You will need a Debian Jessie x64 system and a Rasbian based sysroot. Run the command `host-bootstrap` on the host.
Mount the sysroot image and install the `-dev` packages in it along with the cross tools package.
Set your `PATH` on the Host to reach qmake:

```
$ export PATH=$PATH:$(xsysroot -q sysroot)/usr/local/qt5/bin-x86-64`
```

You might need to set the correct path to the sysroot in the file `/usr/local/qt5/bin-x86-64/qt.conf`

You are now ready to cross build QT5 apps from the host.
